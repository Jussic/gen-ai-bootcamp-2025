<example>
<user:input>
    Are you going to eat eggs and miso soup today. It is healthy to eat well.
</user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
    </score_reasons>
